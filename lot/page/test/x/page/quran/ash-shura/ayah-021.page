### Arabic

أَمْ لَهُمْ شُرَكَـٰٓؤُا۟ شَرَعُوا۟ لَهُم مِّنَ ٱلدِّينِ مَا لَمْ يَأْذَنۢ بِهِ ٱللَّهُ ۚ وَلَوْلَا كَلِمَةُ ٱلْفَصْلِ لَقُضِىَ بَيْنَهُمْ ۗ وَإِنَّ ٱلظَّـٰلِمِينَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ

### English

Or do they have associate-gods who have ordained for them some ˹polytheistic˺ beliefs, which Allah has not authorized? Had it not been for ˹prior˺ decree on Judgment, the matter would have certainly been settled between them ˹at once˺. And surely the wrongdoers will suffer a painful punishment.
