### Arabic

تِلْكَ أُمَّةٌ قَدْ خَلَتْ ۖ لَهَا مَا كَسَبَتْ وَلَكُم مَّا كَسَبْتُمْ ۖ وَلَا تُسْـَٔلُونَ عَمَّا كَانُوا۟ يَعْمَلُونَ

### English

That was a community that had already gone before. For them is what they earned and for you is what you have earned. And you will not be accountable for what they have done.
