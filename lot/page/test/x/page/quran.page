The Quran, also romanized Qur’an or Koran, is the central religious text of Islam, believed by Muslims to be a
revelation directly from God (_Allāh_). It is organized in 114 chapters (_sūrah, pl. suwer_) which consist of individual
verses (_āyah_). Besides its religious significance, it is widely regarded as the finest work in Arabic literature, and
has significantly influenced the Arabic language. It is the object of a modern field of academic research known as
Quranic studies.

Muslims believe the Quran was orally revealed by God to the final Islamic prophet Muhammad through the angel Gabriel
incrementally over a period of some 23 years, beginning on the Laylat al-Qadr, when Muhammad was 40, and concluding in
632, the year of his death. Muslims regard the Quran as Muhammad’s most important miracle, a proof of his prophethood,
and the culmination of a series of divine messages starting with those revealed to the first Islamic prophet Adam,
including the holy books of the Torah, Psalms, and Gospel in Islam.

The Quran is believed by Muslims to be God’s own divine speech providing a complete code of conduct across all facets of
life. This has led Muslim theologians to fiercely debate whether the Quran was “created or uncreated”. According to
tradition, several of Muhammad’s companions served as scribes, recording the revelations. Shortly after Muhammad’s
death, the Quran was compiled on the order of the first caliph Abu Bakr (r. 632–634) by the companions, who had written
down or memorized parts of it. Caliph Uthman (r. 644–656) established a standard version, now known as the Uthmanic
codex, which is generally considered the archetype of the Quran known today. There are, however, variant readings, with
some differences in meaning.

The Quran assumes the reader’s familiarity with major narratives recounted in the Biblical and apocryphal texts. It
summarizes some, dwells at length on others and, in some cases, presents alternative accounts and interpretations of
events. The Quran describes itself as a book of guidance for humankind ([2:185](https://quran.com/2?startingVerse=185)).
It sometimes offers detailed accounts of specific historical events, and it often emphasizes the moral significance of
an event over its narrative sequence.

Supplementing the Quran with explanations for some cryptic Quranic narratives, and rulings that also provide the basis
for Islamic law in most denominations of Islam, are hadiths—oral and written traditions believed to describe words and
actions of Muhammad. During prayers, the Quran is recited only in Arabic. Someone who has memorized the entire Quran is
called a _hafiz_. Ideally, verses are recited with a special kind of prosody reserved for this purpose called _tajwid_.
During the month of Ramadan, Muslims typically complete the recitation of the whole Quran during _tarawih_ prayers. In
order to extrapolate the meaning of a particular Quranic verse, Muslims rely on exegesis, or commentary rather than a
direct translation of the text. [^1]
