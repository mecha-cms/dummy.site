Hurricanes generally occur in the North Atlantic from May through November, with the peak of the hurricane season in
September; only rarely will they occur from December through April in that part of the ocean. The main reason for the
occurance of hurricanes during this period is that the temperature on the waterâ€™s surface is at its warmest and the
humidity of the air is at its highest.

Of the tropical storms that occur each year in the North Atlantic, only about five, on the average, are powerful enough
to be called hurricanes. To be classified as a hurricane, a tropical storm must have winds reaching speeds of at least
117 kilometers per hour, but the winds are often much stronger than that; the winds of intense hurricanes can easily
surpass 240 kilometers per hour.
