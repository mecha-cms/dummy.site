In physics, **mass–energy equivalence** is the relationship between mass and energy in a system’s rest frame, where the
two quantities differ only by a multiplicative constant and the units of measurement. The principle is described by the
physicist Albert Einstein’s formula: \$E=mc^2\$. In a reference frame where the system is moving, its relativistic
energy and relativistic mass (instead of rest mass) obey the same formula.

The formula defines the energy \$E\$ of a particle in its rest frame as the product of mass (\$m\$) with the speed of
light squared (\$c^2\$). Because the speed of light is a large number in everyday units (approximately 300000 km/s or
186000 mi/s), the formula implies that a small amount of “rest mass”, measured when the system is at rest, corresponds
to an enormous amount of energy, which is independent of the composition of the matter.

Rest mass, also called invariant mass, is a fundamental physical property that is independent of momentum, even at
extreme speeds approaching the speed of light. Its value is the same in all inertial frames of reference. Massless
particles such as photons have zero invariant mass, but massless free particles have both momentum and energy.

The equivalence principle implies that when energy is lost in chemical reactions, nuclear reactions, and other energy
transformations, the system will also lose a corresponding amount of mass. The energy, and mass, can be released to the
environment as radiant energy, such as light, or as thermal energy. The principle is fundamental to many fields of
physics, including nuclear and particle physics.

Mass–energy equivalence arose from special relativity as a paradox described by the French polymath Henri Poincaré
(1854–1912). Einstein was the first to propose the equivalence of mass and energy as a general principle and a
consequence of the symmetries of space and time. The principle first appeared in “Does the inertia of a body depend upon
its energy-content?”, one of his annus mirabilis papers, published on 21 November 1905. The formula and its relationship
to momentum, as described by the energy–momentum relation, were later developed by other physicists.

### Description

Mass–energy equivalence states that all objects having mass, or _massive objects_, have a corresponding intrinsic
energy, even when they are stationary. In the rest frame of an object, where by definition it is motionless and so has
no momentum, the mass and energy are equal or they differ only by a constant factor, the speed of light squared
(\$c^2\$).

In relativity, all the energy that moves with an object (i.e., the energy as measured in the object’s rest frame)
contributes to the total mass of the body, which measures how much it resists acceleration. If an isolated box of ideal
mirrors could contain light, the individually massless photons would contribute to the total mass of the box by the
amount equal to their energy divided by \$c^2\$.

### Mass in Special Relativity

An object moves at different speeds in different frames of reference, depending on the motion of the observer. This
implies the kinetic energy, in both Newtonian mechanics and relativity, is ‘frame dependent’, so that the amount of
relativistic energy that an object is measured to have depends on the observer. The _relativistic mass_ of an object is
given by the relativistic energy divided by \$c^2\$. Because the relativistic mass is exactly proportional to the
relativistic energy, relativistic mass and relativistic energy are nearly synonymous; the only difference between them
is the units.

### Efficiency

In some reactions, matter particles can be destroyed and their associated energy released to the environment as other
forms of energy, such as light and heat. One example of such a conversion takes place in elementary particle
interactions, where the rest energy is transformed into kinetic energy. Such conversions between types of energy happen
in nuclear weapons, in which the protons and neutrons in atomic nuclei lose a small fraction of their original mass,
though the mass lost is not due to the destruction of any smaller constituents.

As most of the mass which comprises ordinary objects resides in protons and neutrons, converting all the energy of
ordinary matter into more useful forms requires that the protons and neutrons be converted to lighter particles, or
particles with no mass at all.

Many extensions of the standard model contain magnetic monopoles, and in some models of grand unification, these
monopoles catalyze proton decay, a process known as the Callan–Rubakov effect. This process would be an efficient
mass–energy conversion at ordinary temperatures, but it requires making monopoles and anti-monopoles, whose production
is expected to be inefficient. Another method of completely annihilating matter uses the gravitational field of black
holes. The British theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking theorized it is possible to throw matter into a black hole and
use the emitted heat to generate power. According to the theory of Hawking radiation, however, larger black holes
radiate less than smaller ones, so that usable power can only be produced by small black holes.

### Extension for Systems in Motion

Unlike a system’s energy in an inertial frame, the relativistic energy (\$E\_\{\\rm \{rel\}\}\$) of a system depends on
both the rest mass (\$m\_\{0\}\$) and the total momentum of the system. The extension of Einstein’s equation to these
systems is given by:

$$ E\_\{\\rm rel\} = \\sqrt\{ \(m\_0 c^2\)^2 + \(pc\)^2 \} \\,\\! $$

where the \$\(pc\)^\{2\}\$ term represents the square of the
[Euclidean norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_norm) (total vector length) of the various momentum vectors in
the system, which reduces to the square of the simple momentum magnitude, if only a single particle is considered. This
equation is called the energy–momentum relation and reduces to \$E\_\{\\rm \{rel\}\}=mc^\{2\}\$ when the momentum term
is zero. For photons where \$m\_\{0\}=0\$, the equation reduces to \$E\_\{\\rm \{rel\}\}=pc\$.

### Low-Speed Expansion

Using the [Lorentz factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_factor), \$γ\$, the energy–momentum can be rewritten as
\$E = γmc^2\$ and expanded as a power series:

<div>
$$
E = m_0 c^2 \left[1 + \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{v}{c}\right)^2 + \frac{3}{8} \left(\frac{v}{c}\right)^4 + \frac{5}{16} \left(\frac{v}{c}\right)^6 + \ldots \right].
$$
</div>

For speeds much smaller than the speed of light, higher-order terms in this expression get smaller and smaller because
\$\\tfrac\{v\}\{c\}\$ is small. For low speeds, all but the first two terms can be ignored:

<div>
$$
E \approx m_0 c^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_0 v^2.
$$
</div>

In classical mechanics, both the \$m\_0c^2\$ term and the high-speed corrections are ignored. The initial value of the
energy is arbitrary, as only the change in energy can be measured and so the \$m\_0c^2\$ term is ignored in classical
physics. While the higher-order terms become important at higher speeds, the Newtonian equation is a highly accurate
low-speed approximation; adding in the third term yields:

<div>
$$
E \approx m_0 c^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_0 v^2 \left(1 + \frac{3v^2}{4c^2}\right)
$$
</div>

The difference between the two approximations is given by \$\\tfrac\{3v^\{2\}\}\{4c^\{2\}\}\$, a number very small for
everyday objects. In 2018 NASA announced the Parker Solar Probe was the fastest ever, with a speed of 153,454 miles per
hour (68,600 m/s). The difference between the approximations for the Parker Solar Probe in 2018 is
\$\\tfrac\{3v^\{2\}\}\{4c^\{2\}\}\\approx 3.9 \\times 10^\{-8\}\$, which accounts for an energy correction of four parts
per hundred million. The gravitational constant, in contrast, has a standard relative uncertainty of about
\$2.2 \\times 10^\{-5\}\$.
