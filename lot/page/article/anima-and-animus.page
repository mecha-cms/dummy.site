The anima and animus are described in Carl Jung’s school of analytical psychology as part of his theory of the
collective unconscious. Jung described the animus as the unconscious masculine side of a woman, and the anima as the
unconscious feminine side of a man, each transcending the personal psyche. Jung’s theory states that the anima and
animus are the two primary anthropomorphic archetypes of the unconscious mind, as opposed to the theriomorphic and
inferior function of the shadow archetypes. He believed they are the abstract symbol sets that formulate the archetype
of the Self.

In Jung’s theory, the anima makes up the totality of the unconscious feminine psychological qualities that a man
possesses and the animus the masculine ones possessed by a woman. He did not believe they were an aggregate of father or
mother, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, or teachers, though these aspects of the personal unconscious can influence a
person’s anima or animus.

Jung believed a male’s sensitivity is often lesser or repressed, and therefore considered the anima one of the most
significant autonomous complexes. Jung believed the anima and animus manifest themselves by appearing in dreams and
influence a person’s attitudes and interactions with the opposite sex. Jung said that “the encounter with the shadow is
the ‘apprentice-piece’ in the individual’s development … that with the anima is the ‘masterpiece’”. Jung viewed the
anima process as being one of the sources of creative ability. In his book The Invisible Partners, John A. Sanford said
that the key to controlling one’s anima/animus is to recognize it when it manifests and exercise our ability to discern
the anima/animus from reality.

### Anima

Anima originated from Latin, and was originally used to describe ideas such as breath, soul, spirit or vital force. Jung
began using the term in the early 1920s to describe the inner feminine side of men.

#### Levels of Anima Development

Jung believed anima development has four distinct levels, which in “The psychology of the transference” he named Eve,
Helen, Mary and Sophia. In broad terms, the entire process of anima development in a man is about the male subject
opening up to emotionality, and in that way a broader spirituality, by creating a new conscious paradigm that includes
intuitive processes, creativity and imagination, and psychic sensitivity towards himself and others where it might not
have existed previously.

##### Eve

The first is Eve, named after the Genesis account of Adam and Eve. It deals with the emergence of a man’s object of
desire. The anima is completely tied up with woman as provider of nourishment, security and love.

The man at this anima level cannot function well without a woman, and is more likely to be controlled by her. He is
often impotent or has no sexual desire.

##### Helen

The second is Helen, an allusion to Helen of Troy in Greek mythology. In this phase, women are viewed as capable of
worldly success and of being self-reliant, intelligent and insightful, even if not altogether virtuous. This second
phase is meant to show a strong schism in external talents (cultivated business and conventional skills) with lacking
internal qualities (inability for virtue, lacking faith or imagination).

##### Mary

The third phase is Mary, named after the Christian theological understanding of the Virgin Mary (Jesus’ mother). At this
level, women can now seem to possess virtue by the perceiving man (even if in an esoteric and dogmatic way), in as much
as certain activities deemed consciously unvirtuous cannot be applied to her.

##### Sophia

The fourth and final phase of anima development is Sophia, named after the Greek word for wisdom. Complete integration
has now occurred, which allows women to be seen and related to as particular individuals who possess both positive and
negative qualities. The most important aspect of this final level is that, as the personification “Wisdom” suggests, the
anima is now developed enough that no single object can fully and permanently contain the images to which it is related.

### Animus

Animus originated from Latin, where it was used to describe ideas such as the rational soul, life, mind, mental powers,
courage or desire. In the early nineteenth century, animus was used to mean “temper” and was typically used in a hostile
sense. In 1923, it began being used as a term in Jungian psychology to describe the masculine side of women.

#### Levels of Animus Development

Jung focused more on the man’s anima and wrote less about the woman’s animus. Jung believed that every woman has an
analogous animus within her psyche, this being a set of unconscious masculine attributes and potentials. He viewed the
animus as being more complex than the anima, postulating that women have a host of animus images whereas the male anima
consists only of one dominant image.

Jung stated that there are four parallel levels of animus development in a woman.

##### Man of Mere Physical Power

The animus “first appears as a personification of mere physical power — for instance as an athletic champion or muscle
man, such as ‘the fictional jungle hero Tarzan’”.

##### Man of Action or Romance

In the next phase, the animus “possesses initiative and the capacity for planned action … the romantic man — the 19th
century British poet Byron; or the man of action — America’s Ernest Hemingway, war hero, hunter, etc.”

##### Man as a Professor, Clergyman, Orator

In the third phase “the animus becomes the word, often appearing as a professor or clergyman … the bearer of the word —
Lloyd George, the great political orator”.

##### Man as a Spiritual Guide

“Finally, in his fourth manifestation, the animus is the incarnation of meaning. On this highest level he becomes (like
the anima) a mediator of … spiritual profundity”. Jung noted that “in mythology, this aspect of the animus appears as
Hermes, messenger of the gods; in dreams he is a helpful guide.” Like Sophia, this is the highest level of mediation
between the unconscious and conscious mind. In the book The Invisible Partners, John A. Sanford said that the key to
controlling one’s anima/animus is to recognize it when it manifests and exercise our ability to discern the anima/animus
from reality.

The four roles are not identical with genders reversed. Jung believed that while the anima tended to appear as a
relatively singular female personality, the animus may consist of a conjunction of multiple male personalities: “in this
way the unconscious symbolizes the fact that the animus represents a collective rather than a personal element”.
