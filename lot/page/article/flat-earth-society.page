The International Flat Earth Research Society (IFERS), better known as the Flat Earth Society, was set up by Samuel
Shenton in 1956, in Dover, UK, as a direct descendant of the Universal Zetetic Society. This was just before the Soviet
Union launched the first artificial satellite, Sputnik; he responded: “Would sailing round the Isle of Wight prove that
it were spherical? It is just the same for those satellites.”

His primary aim was to reach children before they were convinced about a spherical Earth. Despite plenty of publicity,
the space race eroded Shenton’s support in Britain until 1967, when he started to become famous due to the Apollo
program.

In 1972, Shenton’s role was taken over by Charles K. Johnson, a correspondent from California, US. He incorporated the
IFERS and steadily built it up to about 3000 members. He spent years examining the studies of flat—and round—Earth
theories and proposed evidence of a conspiracy against flat Earth: “The idea of a spinning globe is only a conspiracy of
error that Moses, Columbus, and FDR all fought…” His article was published in the magazine Science Digest in 1980. It
goes on to state: “If it is a sphere, the surface of a large body of water must be curved. The Johnsons have checked the
surfaces of Lake Tahoe and the Salton Sea without detecting any curvature.”

The Society declined in the 1990s following a fire at its headquarters in California, and Johnson died in 2001. It was
revived as a website in 2004 by Daniel Shenton (no relation to Samuel Shenton). He believes that no one has provided
proof that the world is not flat.
