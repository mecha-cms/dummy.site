Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (1807-1882) was perhaps the best-known American poet of the nineteenth century. His clear
writing style and emphasis on the prevalent values of the period made him popular with the general public if not always
with the critics. He was particularly recognized for his longer narrative poems _Evangeline_, _The Song of Hiawatha_,
and _The Courtship of Miles Standish_, in which he told stories from American history in terms of the values of the
time.

_Evangeline_ was set during the French and Indian war (1754-1763), when the British forced French settlers from Nova
Scotia; two lovers, Gabriel and Evangeline, were separated by the sentimental, undying love, _Evangeline_ was immensely
popular with the public.

In _The Song of Hiawatha_, Longfellow depicted the nobile life of the American Indian through the story of the brave
Hiawatha and his beloved wife Minehaha. The tear-inspiring poem follows Hiawatha through the tragedies and triumphs of
life, ending with the death of Minehaha and Hiawatha’s departure into the sunset in his canoe.

_The Courtship of Miles Standish_ takes place during the early period of settlement of New England, a period which was
viewed as a time of honor and romance. In this poem centered around a love triangle, Miles Standish asks his friend John
Alden to propose to Priscilla Mullins for him; John Alden ends up marrying Priscilla Mullins himself, and it takes time
for his friendship with Miles Standish to recover. As with Longfellow’s other narrative poems, the emphasis on high
ideals and romance made the poem extremely popular.
